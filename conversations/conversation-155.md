## Key Points
- should I go to out of network dentist where reasonable amount of coverage is unknown It depends on a few key factors — here’s how to decide: --- ### 🧾 1.
- Understand “reasonable and customary” coverage When you go **out of network**, your dental insurer typically reimburses based on what *they* consider the “reasonable and customary” (R&C) rate for a procedure — not what the dentist actually charges.
- - If the dentist charges **more than that**, you’re responsible for the difference.
- - Example: Insurance says a crown should cost $900.
- The dentist charges $1,400.
- Insurance covers 50% of $900 ($450), and you pay **$950** ($1,400 – $450).

## Open Questions
- - Does your plan **cover implants** or only bridges?
- - What’s the **R&C rate** in your ZIP code for implant and crown codes (D6010, D6065, D6240, etc.)?
- I can give you a **numerical example** of what the insurer will likely reimburse versus what you’d pay out-of-pocket for your exact situation. Would you like me to do that?
- If you like, I can **check the MetLife network directory around Glen Rose** and pull a longer list of **5-10 in-network dentists** (including specialists if needed) for you. Would that be helpful?
