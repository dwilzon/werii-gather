- Where are my previous chats If you’re using ChatGPT in the desktop app (or on the web), your previous chats should appear in the **left-hand sidebar** under the search bar.
- If you don’t see them, here are a few common reasons: 1.

- **You’re not signed in** – If you’re in “guest” mode, chats won’t be saved.
