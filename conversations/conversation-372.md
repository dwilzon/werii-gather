# H3O2 structure explanation

## Summary
what does h3o2 look like **H₃O₂⁻** (commonly called the **hydroxide-water dimer anion**) is an unusual but well-studied **anion** made of: - **2 hydrogen atoms** bonded to **1 oxygen** (like water, H₂O) - A **third hydrogen** that bridges two oxygens, forming a **hydrogen bond** - A **net negative charge (-1)** ### Structure of H₃O₂⁻: It looks like this: ``` H | O···H···O⁻ | H ``` ### Description: - The two **O atoms** are connected by a strong *...
