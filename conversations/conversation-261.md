# Testosterone dosing frequency

## Summary
When testosterone levels are 1253 6 days after taking 1ml 200mg/ml testosterone cypionate with polycemia - how do those levels change if you either take .5ml every 3.5 days vs taking .5ml every 7 days? Good question — this is about how dosing frequency affects serum testosterone peaks, troughs, and stability, especially in the context of high levels (1253 ng/dL) and polycythemia risk. Here’s how it breaks down: --- ## 1. Pharmacokinetics of Testo...

- Testosterone dosing frequency

## Next Actions
- [ ] If levels remain >1000 ng/dL consistently, a dose reduction (100–150 mg/week) plus split dosing is often the next step.

## Key Points
- When testosterone levels are 1253 6 days after taking 1ml 200mg/ml testosterone cypionate with polycemia - how do those levels change if you either take .5ml every 3.5 days vs taking .5ml every 7 days?
- Good question — this is about how dosing frequency affects serum testosterone peaks, troughs, and stability, especially in the context of high levels (1253 ng/dL) and polycythemia risk.
- Here’s how it breaks down: --- ## 1.
- Pharmacokinetics of Testosterone Cypionate - Testosterone cypionate has a half-life of about **7–8 days** (intramuscular injection).
- - After an injection, levels **peak within 24–72 hours**, then gradually decline until the next shot.
- - Larger, less frequent doses → higher peaks and lower troughs.

## Open Questions
- When testosterone levels are 1253 6 days after taking 1ml 200mg/ml testosterone cypionate with polycemia - how do those levels change if you either take .5ml every 3.5 days vs taking .5ml every 7 days?
- so you can **see visually** how peaks/troughs differ?
