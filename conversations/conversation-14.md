# Guitar signal chain setup

## Summary
Are you suppose to go guitar pickup 1/4" out to 1/4" in lr baggs session - then xlr di out to motu m4 xlr input rather than going directly from 1/4 acoustic pickup to motu m4 Short answer: **Yes — if you’re using the LR Baggs Session DI, the correct chain is:** **Guitar (¼” TS) → LR Baggs Session DI (¼” IN) → XLR OUT → MOTU M4 XLR input** And **not** directly ¼” from the guitar to the MOTU M4. Here’s why it matters: --- ## 🔧 **Correct Signal Chai...

## Key Points
- Are you suppose to go guitar pickup 1/4" out to 1/4" in lr baggs session - then xlr di out to motu m4 xlr input rather than going directly from 1/4 acoustic pickup to motu m4 Short answer: **Yes — if you’re using the LR Baggs Session DI, the correct chain is:*
- Here’s why it matters: --- ## 🔧 **Correct Signal Chain** **1.
- Guitar Pickup (¼” TS, high-impedance) → LR Baggs Session DI Input** - Acoustic pickups *need* a high-impedance input to sound right.
- - The Session DI is designed exactly for this (like the Venue DI, Para DI, etc.).
- LR Baggs Session DI → XLR DI Out → MOTU M4 XLR Mic Input** - The Session DI outputs a **balanced, mic-level XLR signal**.
- - Your MOTU M4 mic preamps expect exactly that and will add clean gain as needed.

## Open Questions
- What is proper way to setup both acoustic guitar and voice microphone into motu m4 then pipe that into garageband - and is it better to use logic?
