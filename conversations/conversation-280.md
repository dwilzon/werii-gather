# Okta Intune integration

## Summary
Okta and Intune integration for device access policies Integrating **Okta** with **Microsoft Intune** allows you to enforce **device-based access policies** by combining identity-driven security with device compliance checks. This integration is commonly used to secure enterprise applications—especially when using **Okta Device Access (ODA)** and conditional access requirements for managed and unmanaged endpoints. --- ## **1.

## Key Points
- Okta and Intune integration for device access policies Integrating **Okta** with **Microsoft Intune** allows you to enforce **device-based access policies** by combining identity-driven security with device compliance checks.
- This integration is commonly used to secure enterprise applications—especially when using **Okta Device Access (ODA)** and conditional access requirements for managed and unmanaged endpoints.
- Why Integrate Okta with Intune** The goal is to ensure that only **compliant, trusted devices**—as managed by Intune—can access sensitive apps and resources authenticated via Okta.
- Key benefits: - Enforce **zero-trust access** policies.
- - Use **Intune compliance states** (compliant, non-compliant, unknown) in Okta policies.
- - Block or restrict access from **unmanaged devices**.

## Open Questions
- Do you want me to prepare that diagram next?
- Is there a way to block downloads or screenshots of data at a company website from personal devices?
- Can Okta determine how a user is authenticating to an app, say from a browser or an app?
- Do you want me to put that together?
- Can I create application policies for an oidc web app that detects if a user is coming from a browser, can Okta whitelist and block access, unless user is logging into the app from a native app?
- Do you want me to build that diagram?
