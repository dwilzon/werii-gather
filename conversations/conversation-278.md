## Key Points

- Let me break this down for you: --- ## 🛠️ What Elimity Does Elimity is an **identity analytics and role mining platform**.
- It focuses on helping organizations get visibility into who has access to what, and then discover patterns to create more manageable and risk-aware access models.
- Key capabilities: - **Data ingestion & analytics**: Pulls in entitlement/access data from systems (like SailPoint, AD, Okta, etc.) and presents a clean picture of user-to-access relationships.
- - **Role mining**: Uses algorithms to detect common access patterns across user populations (e.g., “80% of Finance users have these 5 entitlements”).
- - **Role simulation**: Lets you test how proposed roles would impact users before deploying them.

## Open Questions
- - Who would gain/lose access?
- - Are there SoD conflicts?
- - Does it reduce orphan entitlements?
- Who should certify SailPoint functional roles?
- ## 📌 Who Should Certify Functional Roles?
