# Gas volume pressure temperature formulas

## Summary
formula for calculating volume, temperature and pressure changes of gases Here are the key **gas laws** and formulas used to calculate changes in **volume (V)**, **temperature (T)**, and **pressure (P)** of gases: --- ### **1. Boyle’s Law (Pressure–Volume Relationship)** For a fixed amount of gas at constant temperature: \[ P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 \] **Use when:** Temperature is constant (isothermal process). --- ### **2. Charles’s Law (Volume–Temperat...

## Key Points
- formula for calculating volume, temperature and pressure changes of gases Here are the key **gas laws** and formulas used to calculate changes in **volume (V)**, **temperature (T)**, and **pressure (P)** of gases: --- ### **1.
- Boyle’s Law (Pressure–Volume Relationship)** For a fixed amount of gas at constant temperature: \[ P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 \] **Use when:** Temperature is constant (isothermal process).
- Charles’s Law (Volume–Temperature Relationship)** For a fixed amount of gas at constant pressure: \[ \frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2} \] **Use when:** Pressure is constant (isobaric process).
- *(Temperature must be in Kelvin.)* --- ### **3.
- Gay-Lussac’s Law (Pressure–Temperature Relationship)** For a fixed amount of gas at constant volume: \[ \frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2} \] **Use when:** Volume is constant (isochoric process).
- *(Temperature must be in Kelvin.)* --- ### **4.

## Open Questions
- Would you like me to include **sample problems with step-by-step solutions** showing how to apply each law (e.g., “gas expands when heated” or “compressed air tank cooling”)?
- Would you like me to show how to **compare isothermal vs adiabatic compression** for the same starting gas (for example, compressing air from 1 atm to 5 atm) — including resulting temperature rise and required work?
- ## 2. Does oxygen turn into liquid if you squeeze it?
- ### Thermodynamics: when does “gas” stop being a gas?
- what about compressing other gases?
- Would you like me to do that for a specific gas?
- ## 🧊 3. What if you *do* cool it?
- Would you like me to show a **numerical example** (e.g., compressing 1 L of neon from 1 atm to 200 atm) with the resulting temperature and energy/work required?
