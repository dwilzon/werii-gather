# Best acoustic pickup systems

## Summary
what is the best sounding acoustic pickup that will have a mic and a combination of one or more other sound capturing devices Short list of the best “mic-plus-something” systems (natural sound first, feedback resistance second): 1) LR Baggs **HiFi Duet** (bridge-plate sensors + internal mic) Most “studio-mic’d” vibe I’ve heard in an all-in-one. It blends Baggs’ HiFi bridge-plate pickups with their Silo mic via a studio-grade preamp and crossover,...

## Next Actions
- [ ] – The **SA-6** gives you flexibility, but you’ll need to keep the mic blend low.
- [ ] | **Simplicity in live use** | More hands-on — you may need to adjust blend or mic level per stage. | More “set-it-and-forget-it” — often you can find one blend that works reasonably well in many contexts. |
- [ ] You want **more natural, mic-like tone** inside the guitar, minimizing your need to mic externally at home.
- [ ] **Anthem** (undersaddle + internal mic) is often more forgiving in terms of fit, since the mic is mounted differently and the sensor doesn’t need to be glued to the bridge plate.
- [ ] If your guitar still has the original narrow strap button hole, it will need to be drilled out to ½". This is standard for almost all pickup installs but worth noting.
- [ ] **Result:** To mount Sta-Tites, you’d either need to fill/plug the Waverly screw holes or drill new ones.
- [ ] **Result:** You’d need to ream the headstock — not reversible. Definitely *not* a drop-in swap for Waverlys.
- [ ] If you want **Grovers specifically**, the **Sta-Tite 18:1** is closest, but you’ll need to drill tiny new pilot holes for the screws (the post holes will fit fine).

- It blends Baggs’ HiFi bridge-plate pickups with their Silo mic via a studio-grade preamp and crossover, letting you go from punchy to airy without the plasticky piezo edge.
- Great for modern worship/recording where you want realism and control.
- citeturn0search2turn0search5 2) LR Baggs **Anthem** (undersaddle + internal mic) A proven classic.
- The Tru•Mic carries most of the tone while the Element undersaddle fills in body/low end; you can mix to taste.
- If you want a widely-installed, road-tested system that sounds “like your guitar, only louder,” this is it.

## Open Questions
- Would you like me to lay out a **step-by-step install + EQ/DI setup cheat sheet for your Martin 000-28 MD** so you’ll have the exact knobs/eq points to start with for your worship room?
- Would you like me to draw up a **dual-use workflow** for your setup — how to plug in your 000-28 with a HiFi Duet (or Anthem) for worship **and** how to run it into your home recording chain for the best results?
- Would you like me to also compare these magnetic options directly against the **Anthem and HiFi Duet** so you can see whether going “soundhole magnetic” or “internal mic + pickup” is the better long-term fit for your Martin?
- Do you want me to make a **final recommendation chart** (Anthem vs. HiFi Duet vs. M80 vs. SA-6) specifically for your **Martin 000-28 Modern Deluxe worship + recording setup** so you can see which one really fits long-term?
- Would you like me to now create a **final comparison chart with all 5 contenders (Anthem, HiFi Duet, M80, SA-6, Double Helix Duo)** side by side so you can see exactly which one checks the most boxes for your Martin and your worship + recor
- If you like, I can build a **direct tonal / workflow comparison** for *your Martin 000-28 MD* with Trinity vs HiFi Duet in your worship + home studio setting, so you can see expected tone differences, mic levels, feedback thresholds, etc. D
- If you like, I can **simulate expected tone curves and feedback thresholds** side-by-side for your guitar in your band mix — to estimate whether Duet’s mic can survive your live setting. Do you want me to run that simulation?
- If you like, I can run a **compatibility check** for your exact 000-28 MD — finding systems confirmed to fit historically in that model — and recommend your **best fit** options (soundhole or internal) that will definitely work. Do you want
