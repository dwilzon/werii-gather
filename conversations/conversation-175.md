- Here's a rough breakdown: --- ## Rough Cost Estimate ### Low/DIY end (you do most of the work, simpler materials) - For a basic wood-frame shed with minimal finish, you might spend **$15–$40 per sq ft** (materials + some extra) in many places.

- ### Mid / contractor-built / nicer materials - If you hire help, use better siding, roofing, doors, maybe windows, etc., costs can go up.
- Prefab or partially prefab structures can fall somewhere between **$20–$100+ per sq ft** depending on quality and finishes.

## Open Questions
- If you tell me your area (city or ZIP), desired materials (wood, metal, vinyl, etc.), and whether you'll do labor yourself or hire someone, I can give a tighter estimate for your situation. Do you want me to do that for your location?
