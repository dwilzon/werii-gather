- ### Plugging into a Speaker - If your speaker is a **powered PA speaker** (QSC, Yamaha, JBL, etc.) with an **XLR input**, you can plug directly from the Session DI’s XLR out.
- You’ll get a **full, balanced, pro-level signal** with great sound.
- - If your speaker only takes **¼” inputs**, you can use the Session DI’s ¼” out, but the XLR is always the cleaner, quieter option.
- - If it’s a **passive speaker**, you’ll need a powered amp or PA head between the DI and the speaker.

## Open Questions
- Would you like me to map out the exact **cables and connection options** you’d need for different setups (home speaker, PA at church, or recording interface at home)?
- If you tell me your **budget** and **typical gig size (rooms, audience size, indoor/outdoor)**, I can pick 2–3 ideal speakers for your setup (Martin + Session DI) and send you links. Want me to filter by price (say under $500, under $300, e
- ## 💡 Which might suit *you* best?
- If you like, I can filter those down to **top 2 or 3 best picks** for your space (say for a bedroom or living room), with links and estimated cost. Do you want me to do that?
- If you like, I can narrow the list to just **compact powered speakers with solid DSP / tone control** that would be ideal for home / practice use (small size, good tone control, not too expensive). Want me to pull those out for you?
- 👉 Would you like me to also compare these against **studio monitors** (like JBL 305P MkII or Yamaha HS series) that also take XLR and give super flat, neutral sound — since those are often better for **bedroom-level practice** than PA speak
- If you like, I can pick **top 2 or 3 monitors** from that list that are *best suited for your room size and practice volume* (with links and price estimates). Do you want me to do that?
- If you like, I can pull up **prices (US / your area)** and the specific **KRK model names** that compare directly to the JBL 308P MkII (e.g. KRK 8" models), and show sample audio demos so you can “hear” which might sound better in your ears
