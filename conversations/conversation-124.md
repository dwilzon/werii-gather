## Open Questions
- Would you like me to walk you through **how to make this the default for all your meetings** (so you don’t have to change it every time)?
- If you like, I can **walk you step-by-step** with screenshots (MacBook / Teams desktop app) for setting this up in your tenant, including how to verify your policy from PowerShell (given your IAM background). Would you like that?

- Would you like me to show how this connects to Paul’s larger argument in Romans 9–11 about Israel, the Gentiles, and God’s plan of redemption?
- Would you like me to include the **Hebrew pronunciation audio** and a short **visual etymology chart** showing this relationship?

- Would you like me to show how *Chavah* (חוה) connects to *Ruach* (spirit/breath) and *Adam* (אָדָם), forming the Hebrew picture of humanity as *breath + blood + life*?
- Would you like me to create a **visual diagram** (in Hebrew and English) showing this “breath → blood → life → relationship” flow — something you could include in your Hebrew study notes or journal?
