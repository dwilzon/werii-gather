## Key Points
- what is blooms taxonomy **Bloom's Taxonomy** is a framework for categorizing educational goals, developed in 1956 by **Benjamin Bloom** and a group of educational psychologists.
- It’s widely used by teachers, curriculum designers, and educators to structure learning objectives, assessments, and activities in a progressive, meaningful way.
- ### 🌱 Original Bloom’s Taxonomy (1956) – Cognitive Domain It organizes cognitive learning into **six hierarchical levels**, from basic to advanced: 1.
- **Knowledge** – Recall facts and basic concepts *E.g., Define, List, Name, Identify* 2.
- **Comprehension** – Understand meaning *E.g., Explain, Summarize, Describe, Interpret* 3.
- **Application** – Use knowledge in new situations *E.g., Solve, Apply, Use, Demonstrate* 4.

## Open Questions
- Would you like an example of how to apply Bloom's Taxonomy to a real-world learning goal (like cybersecurity, Hebrew, or teaching kids)?
- Would you like a Bloom's + Metacognition planning template or example for a specific learning area (e.g., Hebrew, cybersecurity, or studying for certifications)?
- - Are certain tones, words, or posture associated with escalation?
- - Do certain body language cues correlate with successful de-escalation?
- Would you like a sample **data-driven training improvement plan** or a **framework for integrating this into a police academy or department curriculum**?
- > Is the -ing word being used **as a thing** (a subject, object, etc.) rather than an action?
- Would you like a quick quiz or a visual guide to help reinforce the difference between gerunds and participles?
