## Next Actions
- [ ] Create a second shirt in the same “Dustinism” series
- [ ] Create a **series look** so future “Dustinism” shirts match
- [ ] Tell me exactly how to get this shirt printed (though the text isn't quite right and will need to be fixed, but I love the font and the image in the background)

- [ ] Build a **Dustinism series template**
