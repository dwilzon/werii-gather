## Open Questions
- If you want, I can pull up side-by-side comparisons of cost / how they perform in field trials in pigs to help you decide what’s best in a given situation. Do you want me to do that?
- If you like, I can try to estimate for your farm (e.g. size of pig, number of pigs, severity of disease) what the total cost vs benefit might be for each option — that might help you decide practically. Do you want me to do that?
- Do you want me to also give you a **step-by-step treatment protocol example** (dose calculation, injection sites, handling tips) for a typical group of pigs?
- Would you like me to also make a **quick chart/print-friendly dosing table** (weight ranges vs dose in mL) so you can use it in the barn for multiple pigs?
