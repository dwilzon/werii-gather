## Summary
Worst thing he's ever gone through in his life Can you clarify who you’re referring to when you say “he”? What is ejection fraction in the heart **Ejection fraction (EF)** is a measurement of how well your heart pumps blood with each beat. More specifically: - It’s the **percentage of blood that the left ventricle pumps out** each time it contracts. - For example, if the left ventricle fills with 100 mL of blood and pumps out 60 mL, the ejection...

## Key Points
- Worst thing he's ever gone through in his life Can you clarify who you’re referring to when you say “he”?
- What is ejection fraction in the heart **Ejection fraction (EF)** is a measurement of how well your heart pumps blood with each beat.
- More specifically: - It’s the **percentage of blood that the left ventricle pumps out** each time it contracts.
- - For example, if the left ventricle fills with 100 mL of blood and pumps out 60 mL, the ejection fraction is **60%**.
- ### Normal and Abnormal Ranges | EF Range | Meaning | Interpretation | |-----------|----------|----------------| | **55–70%** | Normal | Heart is pumping efficiently | | **41–54%** | Slightly below normal | Possible mild dysfunction | | **36–40%** | Moderately

## Open Questions
- Can you clarify who you’re referring to when you say “he”?
- Would you like me to explain what it means if someone’s ejection fraction is low — what causes it and how it’s treated?
- Would you like me to outline what **a realistic recovery plan or prognosis** looks like for someone with 15% EF (including how it can sometimes improve)?
- If you’d like, I can outline a **sample day-by-day schedule for early recovery walking and breathing exercises** that stay within a safe heart-rate range for someone at 44 bpm baseline. Would you like that?
- If you tell me his **post-surgery timeline (weeks since operation)** and **latest EF reading**, I can outline a specific **weekly PT progression plan** showing when to add each type of movement safely. Would you like that?
- Do you want me to outline what an **effective treatment path or next step** would look like for someone in that state (like the kind of facility or program that can actually help)?
- If you’d like, I can help you sketch what a **spirit-centered recovery path** might look like — something that honors both the body and the soul, not just symptom control. Would you want that?
- Do you possibly mean **“euvolemic”**?
