## Key Points
- This morning while in church at First Baptist in Glen Rose they brought up becoming a member.
- I began thinking about that and wondered if I can be a “member” while also being a part of Sar Shalom.
- I talked to the pastor and he mentioned that there is no concept of dual membership, but I am welcome to keep coming.
- I really started to wonder what “membership” meant, as it seems a little foreign to me as we are all members of the Body if Messiah.
- Amanda and I started discussing it.
- I mentioned to her that every time I hear Erick Tokager say he is a Messianic Jew I get a little confused, As I’ve been saying for years I’m a Messianic Jew - in my mind for many years when you receive Yeshua, you follow him and become Jewish… notwithstanding 

## Open Questions
- Would you like me to help you draft a way to explain this clearly—to Amanda, to your pastor, or even just to yourself—almost like a short “identity statement” you can carry with you?
- Would you like me to make a **shorter version** too—something more conversational you could say face-to-face, rather than as a written note?
- Would you like me to also draft a **one-paragraph “face-to-face” version** of this—something you could share verbally with them without feeling like you’re reading a letter?
