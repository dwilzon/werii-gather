# Decision Tree Example

## Summary
Show me an example of a decision tree --- title: Flowcharts Syntax --- # Flowcharts - Basic Syntax Flowcharts are composed of **nodes** (geometric shapes) and **edges** (arrows or lines). The Mermaid code defines how nodes and edges are made and accommodates different arrow types, multi-directional arrows, and any linking to and from subgraphs. ```warning If you are using the word "end" in a Flowchart node, capitalize the entire word or any of th...

- [ ] You can use the `icon` shape to include an icon in your flowchart. To use icons, you need to register the icon pack first. Follow the instructions provided [here](../config/icons.md). The syntax for defining an icon shape is as follows:
- [ ] Comments can be entered within a flow diagram, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their own line, and must be prefaced with `%%` (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next newline wi
- [ ] For custom icons, you need to use the `fak` prefix.

## Key Points
- Show me an example of a decision tree --- title: Flowcharts Syntax --- # Flowcharts - Basic Syntax Flowcharts are composed of **nodes** (geometric shapes) and **edges** (arrows or lines).
- The Mermaid code defines how nodes and edges are made and accommodates different arrow types, multi-directional arrows, and any linking to and from subgraphs.
- ```warning If you are using the word "end" in a Flowchart node, capitalize the entire word or any of the letters (e.g., "End" or "END"), or apply this [workaround](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/1444#issuecomment-639528897).
- Typing "end" in all lowercase letters will break the Flowchart.
- ``` ```warning If you are using the letter "o" or "x" as the first letter in a connecting Flowchart node, add a space before the letter or capitalize the letter (e.g., "dev--- ops", "dev---Ops").
- Typing "A---oB" will create a [circle edge](#circle-edge-example).
