# Financial forecasting model

## Summary
I am looking for a financial pro-forma forecasting model template that has all of the variables and formualas in place to calculate a comprehensive predictive forecasting model based on various inputs - I would also like to find a way to leverage AI tools to potentially fill in the data of the template, and analyse the results for a much deeper analysis than we could ever do without AI Great — you’re tackling a very smart and strategic idea. Let’...

- IAM Engineering
- Infrastructure
- API Integration

## Next Actions
- [ ] Validated formulas: cells linked properly (so you don’t have hard-coded values hiding behind inputs). Good structure/flow so that you only need to change inputs and the rest auto-updates.
- [ ] Build scenario tabs: duplicate base model into “Best Case”, “Base Case”, “Worst Case” with varying assumptions (growth rates, cost shocks, delay in technology roll-out, etc.).
- [ ] ## ✅ Next Steps for You
- [ ] Create 3 scenarios (Base, Optimistic, Pessimistic) within the template.
- [ ] Use AI to “translate” model outputs into plain-English insights and action items.
- [ ] Please stop linking my personal business work with this projecte.  They are separate.  Okta is not a part of this. instead - we need to fully capture and model the following items and have them represented in the template and included in an

- Let’s break out how you can move forward in **two major parts**: 1.
- Getting or building a **robust pro-forma forecasting model template** (with all the variables & formulas).
- Leveraging **AI tools** to populate, analyse, and enhance that model for deeper insights.
- Pro-Forma Forecasting Template Here are several high-quality resources and what you should look for, plus some thoughts on customizing/strengthening the model.
- ### 🎯 Good Template Sources - entity["organization", "Smartsheet", 0] has a library of free financial projection and forecasting templates (Excel + Google Sheets) for different timeframes (12-mo, 3-yr, 5-yr) and types of business.

## Open Questions
- If you like, I can **locate 3-5 highly rated free or low-cost pro-forma forecasting model templates** (Excel/Google) that include full formulas, and we can **evaluate and pick one** together. Then we can **design the AI integration plan** s
- If you like, I can **download the actual templates** (provide direct download links for you), and **create a customised driver-tab sheet** adapted to *your business model* (Okta engineering + side income + tutoring + smart-home product sale
- Which component would you like built next?
- Which module would you like fully built next?
- ### Before I proceed, can you clarify one of these?
- - Or maybe you meant something else entirely?
