# Loopback support comparison

## Summary
which of the following allow loopback - motu m2, m3 ,m4 , audio i4, or other - Here’s a breakdown of whether the interfaces you mentioned support loopback (i.e., virtual routing of computer/app output back into the interface for recording) — based on their specs and user-reports. ### ✅ Models that *do* support loopback - product_entity["turn0product0","MOTU M2"]: Yes. MOTU’s M-Series driver supports “Loopback 1-2” input channels for capturing...

## Open Questions
- If you like, I can **scan the market** (2025 models) and pull together **10-15 audio interfaces** that explicitly *list* loopback support **with channel counts** (and pricing) so you have a broader comparative list. Would that be helpful?
- - **Routing software / control panel**: How easy is it to mix mic + system audio + maybe other inputs into the loopback output?
- If you like, I can **extend the list** to 15 or 20 interfaces, across price tiers (from ~$150 up to $1000+), filter by “loopback channels ≥ 2”, show approximate prices and key pros/cons side by side. Would you like me to build that full com
- If you like, I can check **ideal cable types** (for your MacBook M4 Pro + MOTU + Bose) and show **recommended settings** in the MOTU driver and in your Mac (or streaming software) for best routing. Would you like that?
- If you like, I can find **a full compatibility table** (model numbers + board part numbers + revisions) for the LREL63xx series ranges so you can see all the accepted part numbers for your specific model and revision. Would you like me to p
- - Or generate a minimal FastAPI + Qdrant starter with the schema and an ingestion script you can run on your Mac. Which route do you want?
- Would you like me to generate that visual?
