# Leverage SCCM for Okta FastPass

## Summary
How can I leverage SCCM windows device registration to show devices are registered in Okta for fastpass use? Excellent question — this is a core challenge when rolling out **Okta FastPass** on **Windows** endpoints, especially in enterprise environments already managed by **SCCM (ConfigMgr)**. Let’s break it down step-by-step so you can leverage **SCCM device data** to confirm **Okta device registration** and readiness for **FastPass (FIDO2/WebAu...

## Next Actions
- [ ] Because the **Modern Deluxe** has a **shorter scale**, the tension difference between these sets is small (~10–12 lbs total), so you **won’t need to adjust the truss rod** if you switch back and forth occasionally.
- [ ] How do I generate a device recovery pin in Okta ODA OIE - how does SCEP need to be configured to allow this

## Key Points
- How can I leverage SCCM windows device registration to show devices are registered in Okta for fastpass use?
- Excellent question — this is a core challenge when rolling out **Okta FastPass** on **Windows** endpoints, especially in enterprise environments already managed by **SCCM (ConfigMgr)**.
- Let’s break it down step-by-step so you can leverage **SCCM device data** to confirm **Okta device registration** and readiness for **FastPass (FIDO2/WebAuthn)** authentication.
- --- ## 🧩 Background FastPass relies on **Okta Verify device binding** — meaning the Windows machine must be: - Enrolled in **Okta Device Registration** (via ODA or Okta Verify for Desktop) - Trust-anchored to your org (via TPM attestation or certificate) - Map
- So your goal is to **use SCCM data to validate and cross-reference device registration status in Okta**.
- --- ## ⚙️ Step 1 — Enable Device Registration in Okta Before leveraging SCCM, confirm: 1.

## Open Questions
- How can I leverage SCCM windows device registration to show devices are registered in Okta for fastpass use?
- Would you like me to build that out for you next?
- Would you like me to include that wiring diagram and GarageBand channel map for your exact Scarlett model?
- Would you like me to show the **exact tension chart** (lbs per string) for both gauges on your 000-28 scale length, so you can see the numeric difference in pull and response?
- Would you like me to recommend the **best tuner app** optimized for iPhone’s mic sensitivity (and that works great with your Martin 000-28 MD)?
- Understanding all of the research I've done lately regarding guitars, sound, physics, etc... if I could create an LR Baggs product, what would it be?
- Would you like me to design that next?
- Would you like me to tailor one of these to sound more like a **survey response** or a **message directly to L.R. Baggs support/team**?
