## Open Questions
- If you like, I can check whether there’s a direct link/form from OpenAI for Sora invites (or if there are alternate methods like referral). Would you like me to check that?
- If you like, I can check specifically *which channels* (Discord server links, subreddit threads, etc.) currently have active valid invite code posts for Sora — would that be helpful for you?
- If you like, I can look up what your specific credit‐card issuer’s policy is (if you tell me the issuer) or find sample hardship programs for your state (Texas) so you know your rights. Would you like that?
