## Key Points
- can i point to a youtube video playing guitar and chords and strings being played be output to me Not directly.
- YouTube doesn’t expose a way for me to “listen in” to a video and tell you in real time which chords or strings are being played.
- But there are a few ways you could get close to that outcome: ### 1.
- Use Existing Tools - **Chordify**, **Songsterr**, or **Ultimate Guitar** can analyze many songs on YouTube and display the chords in sync with the video.
- - Some plugins or browser extensions try to detect chords in real time, though accuracy varies.
- Manual Workflow - You could share the video link with me, and I can help you find whether a chord chart, tabs, or transcription already exists online for that song.

## Open Questions
- 👉 Do you want me to walk you through how to take a YouTube video, extract the audio, and then I can give you the chords/strings from that? Or would you prefer I help you find existing chord charts for the video?
