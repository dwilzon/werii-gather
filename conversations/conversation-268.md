# Yeshua and worship teachings

## Summary
does Yeshua say to worship him? That’s a thoughtful and important question. If we look at the Gospels, **Yeshua never directly commands people, “Worship me”** in a straightforward phrase. Instead, a few key patterns emerge: ### 1. People Do Worship Him - The disciples worship Him after He calms the storm (Matthew 14:33). - A healed blind man worships Him (John 9:38). - After the resurrection, the women and disciples worship Him (Matthew 28:9, 17)...

## Open Questions
- does Yeshua say to worship him?
- Would you like me to show you the **specific Greek/Hebrew words for “worship”** used in those passages (like *proskyneō* in Greek, *hishtachavah* in Hebrew), so you can see the nuance more deeply?
- Would you like me to create a **mini Hebrew/Greek study sheet** for you—with the words, root letters, pronunciation audio, and example verses—so you can start memorizing and internalizing them in your Hebrew learning?
- 1. Make a **printable PDF / Anki flashcards** with these words, verses, and meanings?
- 2. Or give you a **Mac terminal script** that reads these words aloud (so you can practice pronunciation daily)?
- Would you like me to break down **ἀγαπάω vs. other Greek words for love** (*phileō, eros, storgē*) side-by-side with their Hebrew counterparts, so you see why Yeshua chose *agapaō* here?
- Do you want me to also show you some **different ways people might respond** to a “not” question like this—depending on whether you want to sound factual, reassuring, or a little humorous?
- Would it help if I gave you a **short list of ways you could respond** in those moments (neutral, reassuring, or light-humor), so it keeps the exchange smooth and not defensive?
