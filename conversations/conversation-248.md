# Blood donation weight loss

## Summary
how much weight do you lose donating blood When you donate **one pint of blood** (the standard amount in a whole-blood donation), you lose about **one pound of body weight immediately** — but that’s almost entirely fluid, not fat. Here’s the breakdown: - **Volume**: A pint of blood is ~470–500 ml. - **Weight**: That equals about **1.0–1.1 pounds (0.45–0.5 kg)**. - **Calories**: Your body uses energy to replace the lost blood. Estimates range from...

- [ ] If your **ferritin and iron studies are normal**, there’s no need to cut your daily coffee.
- [ ] **Keep your one cup of coffee** if you enjoy it. No need to stop unless labs show iron deficiency.

## Key Points
- how much weight do you lose donating blood When you donate **one pint of blood** (the standard amount in a whole-blood donation), you lose about **one pound of body weight immediately** — but that’s almost entirely fluid, not fat.
- Here’s the breakdown: - **Volume**: A pint of blood is ~470–500 ml.
- - **Weight**: That equals about **1.0–1.1 pounds (0.45–0.5 kg)**.
- - **Calories**: Your body uses energy to replace the lost blood.
- Estimates range from **500–650 calories** burned during the rebuilding process, spread over a day or two.
- ⚠️ Important notes: - The “weight loss” is temporary since your body quickly replaces plasma with fluids (often within 24 hours if you hydrate).

## Open Questions
- Would you like me to also compare **whole blood vs platelet vs double-red donations** in terms of weight and calorie impact?
- 👉 Do you want me to run a **modeled comparison** of your reported labs (1253 ng/dL at day 6 after 200 mg injection) vs what your **steady state trough/peaks** would look like if you switched to smaller, more frequent doses — and how that mi
- Would you like me to also show a **predicted steady-state peak and trough table** for each protocol (so you can see exact numbers side by side)?
- Do you want me to also convert for other common doses (like 80 mg or 100 mg) so you have a quick reference chart?
- Do you want me to **re-run the simulation calibrated to your actual 1253 ng/dL trough** (instead of the population average), so you can see your personalized peak/trough curves for different dosing strategies?
- Would you like me to **map out a dosing ladder** (40 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg every 3.5 days, and daily microdosing equivalents) so you can see which regimens would get you closer to the guideline target range?
- Would you like me to also map this into a **visual dosing ladder** (e.g. 200 → 160 → 140 → 120 → 100 mg/week equivalents, with their estimated steady-state peaks/troughs), so you can see exactly how reducing the dose steps you down into saf
- 👉 Do you want me to also show you what **daily micro-dosing** (e.g. 20–25 mg every day, ~0.1–0.125 ml) would look like, so you can compare the flattest possible curve?
