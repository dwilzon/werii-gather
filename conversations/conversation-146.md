- Here’s a breakdown of what to consider — based on industry norms and what I found in research.
- --- ### ✅ What you gain - Higher ratio (20:1) tuners typically give finer tuning control and potentially better stability, which is a real benefit for everyday playing.
- - Premium materials (ivoroid buttons, titanium posts) further enhance the feel/finish of the instrument — for your personal use this can make the guitar feel “better.” - If the modification is done cleanly (no damage to headstock, proper fit, good finish), you

## Open Questions
- If you like, I can pull up **real-world sales data** of similar Martin guitars with tuner modifications (to see how much value was affected historically). Would you like that?
- If you like, I can **look up actual sale/relist examples** of 000-28 Modern Deluxe guitars that *have* been modified (tuners or other hardware) and compare what price they achieved versus unmodified ones. Would that extra data help you?
- Would you like me to show you a visual comparison of the *butterbean gold 16:1* vs *ivoroid titanium 20:1* tuners on the 000-28 headstock so you can see how they’ll look before you swap?
- ## 🎯 So: Is $6/month worth it for *you*?
- - Check cancellation/trial policy: can you get started easily, cancel without penalty?
- If you like, I can pull together a **comparison table** of StockAnalysis vs 2-3 other similar services (pricing, features, strengths/weaknesses) so you can decide **whether $6/month for StockAnalysis is the *best value** for your use‐case. 
- If you like, I can **pull up a longer list** (10+ services) with full current pricing, features, free/trial offers, for you to map which one fits *your exact mix* (DIY + blogging + side income) — would that be useful?
- - Industry Position & Trend – Is the industry growing? Are they a leader or laggard?
