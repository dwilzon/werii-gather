# Building custom chatbot

## Summary
how do I build a custom chatbot that can be used to aggregate and maintian all chat history from all ai agents - this is a starting point Here’s the direct, non-fluffy blueprint for building a **custom chatbot that aggregates, indexes, stores, and maintains all chat history from all AI agents** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, your own agents, etc.). Think of this as the starting architecture for a “Unified Memory Layer” that sits above all...

- Think of this as the starting architecture for a “Unified Memory Layer” that sits above all AI systems you use.
- Core Problem You’re Solving** You want a system that: 1.
- **Pulls chat history from every AI agent you use** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, custom GPTs, local LLMs) 2.
- **Normalizes the conversations** Into a unified format (timestamps, agent, source platform, message type, metadata) 3.
- **Stores and indexes all messages** Relational DB + Vector DB 4.
