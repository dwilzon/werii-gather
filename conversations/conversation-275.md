- [ ] Implement exception-based reviews
- [ ] Create automated provisioning rules
- [ ] Implement Recommendation Engine for access requests
- [ ] Immediate Next Steps:
- [ ] The key insight: We're not working around compliance—we're building compliance into the architecture itself. -- Consider some of the following challenges:  Existing thought behind the department that runs SailPoint and RBAC processes believ
- [ ] **Next Step:** Partner with Cybersecurity Policy team and Internal Audit to **clarify written standards** and codify a shared interpretation that supports functional role persistence.
- [ ] ✅ **Next Step Recommendation for You:** Before taking this to executives or Financial Assurance, I’d recommend we build a **“Functional Role Certification Accountability Matrix”** (mapping roles → certifying officer) and a **sample Exceptio

## Key Points
- Considering the following RBAC Strategic Proposal: Strategic Vision for Seamless Identity Lifecycle Management Executive Elevator Pitch (90 seconds) The Challenge: Our current identity management system creates a critical business continuity risk.
- When employees change roles—even simple promotions—we completely revoke and rebuild their access, causing productivity losses measured in days, not hours.
- Last quarter alone, role transitions affected 15% of our workforce, with each transition averaging 3-5 days of reduced productivity.
- The Opportunity: By implementing a functional role architecture layered with intelligent automation, we can transform identity transitions from a business disruption into a seamless experience.
- This isn't just about IT efficiency—it's about maintaining operational continuity, reducing compliance risk, and enabling organizational agility.
- The Solution: A three-tier identity framework that separates who you are from what you do, maintaining core functional access during transitions while dynamically adjusting contextual permissions.

## Open Questions
- Would you like me to **draft that Accountability Matrix and Example Exception Report** so you have concrete artifacts to use in pre-executive discussions?
- 👉 Would you like me to **convert this into a polished slide-ready diagram** (with icons, color flows, and clear executive visuals) so you can drop it into a deck for your steering committee pitch?
