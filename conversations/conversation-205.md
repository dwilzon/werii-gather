- Below I’ll walk through what to look for, trade-offs, and some specific pickups you might consider.

## Open Questions
- If you like, I can help you compare **two or three picks** side-by-side (sound, installation, cost) and pick what’s best *for your guitar*. Would you like me to do that?
- ## Which might be better for your use (worship + home recording)?
- If you want, I can simulate (by listening to sound samples or comparing frequency curves) how much tonal “gap” there is between the two for your guitar style, to help you decide. Do you want me to do that?
- ## For your Martin 000-28 Modern Deluxe + church + home-recording use: is the HiFi Duet a good choice?
- If you want, I can dig up **audio A/B comparisons** between the HiFi Duet and the Anthem (or K&K) so you can hear how “big” the difference might really be — that could help you decide whether the upgrade is worth it for your playing and rec
- ## Which might be better for *your situation*?
- If you like, I can try to find **audio A/B demos** comparing Element VTC vs Gold Plus VTII (or similar pairs) so you can *hear* how big the difference might be on guitars similar to yours. Want me to find and send you those sound demos?
