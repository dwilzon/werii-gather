- ### Why This Matters - **Indemnify** means you agree to step in and cover costs, damages, or liability that someone else incurs.

- ### What to Look Out For - **Broad language** (“any and all claims, including negligence”) → most unfavorable to you.

## Open Questions
- Do you want me to draft some **alternative language** you could propose that limits indemnity to only your own actions?
