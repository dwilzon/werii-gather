## Open Questions
- Would you like a quick diagram showing the correct bleeding order and where each bleeder screw is located on the S70?
- Would you like me to give you the **exact torque specs** for the bleeder screws and the recommended **brake fluid capacity** for the S70?
- If you’re doing it solo, I can outline how to use a **pressure bleeder** or **one-man check-valve bleeder** setup, which combines the speed of the two-person method with single-person convenience. Would you like that?
- Would you like me to list where each bleeder screw is located and the easiest way to access them safely with the car level or on stands?
