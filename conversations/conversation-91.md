- --- # **Short Answer** **It’s only worth doing if you’re NOT planning to actually sequence DNA yourself.** Launching your own sequencing pipeline is expensive, regulated, and crowded.
- But **building analysis, AI-driven reporting, coaching, or niche value-add on top of existing sequencing providers** *can* be profitable with low startup cost.
- --- # **Two Very Different Business Models** ## **1.
- Running actual DNA sequencing (CLIA-lab style)** **Not worth it unless you have millions in capital and regulatory tolerance.** ### **Why it’s generally NOT worth it** - **Equipment cost:** $50,000–$1,000,000+ depending on platform (Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, 
- - **Wet lab + consumables:** thousands per sample at your scale.

## Open Questions
- ## 🎯 Is *it* worth it for *you*?
- If you like, I can check the **latest pricing**, compare it to 2-3 peer services (so you see if you’re getting good value), and we can decide if **you personally** should buy it now (or wait). Would that be helpful?
- If you like, I can **pull a table comparing (say) 4–5 current WGS kits** (features, depth, raw data access, price, membership cost) so you can pick the “best-value” one right now. Would that be useful?
