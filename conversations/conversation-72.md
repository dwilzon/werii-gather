- --- ## ✅ What to look for Before choosing, it helps to be clear on which features matter most for you.
- Based on your situation (Okta engineer, wanting extra income, managing debt, improving well-being via productivity), you may value: - Connection & aggregation: link bank accounts, credit cards, loans, investments.
- - Real-time / near real-time transaction sync and categorization.
- - Budgeting & goal-setting: track income vs expenses, paying off debt, building emergency fund.
- - Forecasting and cash-flow insight (useful if you have irregular income or side-gigs).

## Open Questions
- If you like, I can **pull together a full comparison matrix** of **5-10 apps** (including pricing, pros/cons, ranking) specifically for your use-case (tech professional, side-income, Mac & mobile, debt payoff). Would that be helpful?
- If you like, I can **pull live pricing (US), discount coupons**, and **export/export-to-OneNote compatibility details** for each of the 8 apps (and maybe 2-3 bonus ones) so you can compare more granularly. Would you like that?
