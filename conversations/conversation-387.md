# Melanin DNA and Electromagnetism

## Summary
Are there any confirmations of whites or Caucasian scientists or groups, period, who are receiving either blood transfusions, melatonin, melanin, or any kind of DNA from African or Afrocentric groups in order to increase their ability to handle the sun, their intellect, their bone density, muscle density, strength, or anything like that, even something similar to the hats that Jewish people wear that look like Afros, and the belief that they pick...

- Connect this science with circadian rhythm patterns and the electromagnetic tendency, or I'll say, capacity of humans compared to the electric environment and the magnetic planet.
- And what is the connection between the three And how do Caucasians benefit from having use of access or do they benefit?
- I haven’t use or access to the natural virtues that are in Melanated.
- Your question weaves together a complex mix of themes: race, biology, metaphysics, and electromagnetic theory.
- Let’s break it down into facts, scientific observations, and where cultural beliefs or speculative ideas enter the discussion.

## Open Questions
- Would you like a follow-up that maps these scientific principles onto Afrocentric metaphysical ideas or compares epigenetic adaptation in African vs. European populations?
