- [ ] Feature-set may be simpler in terms of effects compared to Fishman (I didn’t see a huge built-in multi-effects section in the summary) — if you like built-in FX like delays/chorus, you’ll need to check precisely what it offers.
- [ ] I'm not a singer, and I'm fairly new to guitar - but I do want to try practicing with my wife on songs - and I would like to figure out how to strengthen my vocal flap - I am always sick and have problems with my throat  - need to strenghte
- [ ] I have yamaha clp-685 piano already - need to work that into the recordings
- [ ] Create a **stereo audio track** in Logic and arm both channels.
- [ ] Create clean **sheet-music PDFs** and optional **MusicXML** files,
- [ ] 🎧 **Audio (AAC / MP3 / AIFF / WAV)** → usable, but I’ll need to *analyze and transcribe* manually, which takes more processing time
- [ ] Create a visual map of your composition.
- [ ] Please stop telling everything I say is a "fantastic question" or "Great Question" or "That's a beuutiful goal" or "That's a really sharp obversation" -  just be real - if you miss something - that is fine, just fix it - I don't need to be

- I’ll break down their strengths, weaknesses, and which might be better suited depending on your use-case (solo acoustic performance + vocals, PA integration, recording, etc.).
- --- ### ✅ Shared Strengths / Context Both amps are robust, gig-ready acoustic combos around 120 watts, which puts them in a solid category for solo singers/songwriters, small venues, rehearsal spaces, etc.
- - They are bi-amped designs (woofer + tweeter) so they’re designed to handle a wide frequency range for acoustic guitars and vocals.
- - Both offer dual channels (instrument + mic) and include features for acoustic instruments (feedback control, PA/DI outs, etc).
- - Since you work with acoustic guitar + voice (given you’d likely use this for your singing/acoustic sets), both are viable.

## Open Questions
- If you like, I can check **user reviews** and **sound demos** for both (maybe YouTube clips) to see how they actually sound live in different venue sizes, and we can compare price/value in your current market too. Would that be helpful?
- If you tell me what kind of tone you like most (e.g., bright & sparkling vs. warm & mellow), I can suggest the *best next string set* for your **Martin 000-28 MD** — including gauge and coating type — so you get that fresh, alive feel back.
- If you like, I can **pull up direct sound demos** (YouTube clips) of both the Circa 74 and Loudbox Artist, and we can **compare how they sound live with acoustic guitar + vocals** so you hear differences in tone/speaker/room presence. Would
- Would you like me to build that plan for you — one you could follow each morning to strengthen your voice and lungs safely?
- If you like, I can **pull together a specific “shopping list” with estimated budget tiers (Budget / Mid / Premium)** for your scenario (music + podcast) and **recommend some MIDI keyboards** too (since you’ll do MIDI piano). Would you like 
- I searched for my piano a while back - what piano do I have?
- Can you tell me one of the following so I can identify it accurately?
- Would you like me to build a **recommended wiring diagram** (with cable types and Logic Pro input settings) that shows how your CLP-685, guitar, mic, and interface all connect to the MacBook together?
