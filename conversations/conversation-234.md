# Theological vs mathematical infinity

## Summary
How do theological perspectives on infinity align with mathematical and philosophical concepts of the infinite? This is a profound question—one that has been wrestled with for centuries by theologians, philosophers, and mathematicians. The concept of **infinity** bridges these domains, but each approaches it differently: --- ### 1. **Theological Infinity** - **Divine Nature**: In theology, particularly in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thought, i...

## Key Points
- How do theological perspectives on infinity align with mathematical and philosophical concepts of the infinite?
- This is a profound question—one that has been wrestled with for centuries by theologians, philosophers, and mathematicians.
- The concept of **infinity** bridges these domains, but each approaches it differently: --- ### 1.
- **Theological Infinity** - **Divine Nature**: In theology, particularly in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thought, infinity is often tied to Elohim’s attributes—His eternity, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence.
- Infinity expresses that Hashem is without limit in time (eternal), space (omnipresent), power (omnipotent), or knowledge (omniscient).
- - **Qualitative Infinity**: Theological infinity is not just endless quantity, but a **wholly otherness**—God’s transcendence beyond all created categories.

## Open Questions
- How do theological perspectives on infinity align with mathematical and philosophical concepts of the infinite?
- Would you like me to also map this to **Biblical Hebrew and Greek terms** for “infinite” or “eternal” (like עוֹלָם *olam*, αἰών *aiōn*)—since those words shape how theology originally framed the idea?
