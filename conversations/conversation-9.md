## Key Points
- I need to create a roadmap for next year for my company with input from my group.
- I would like to create an intake form / spreadsheet to capture different aspecst of the roadmap - from goals to specifi tasks on the agenda for next year - would like to cover manpower projections and esrtimations and create a comprehensive roadmap.
- However, I am not great at the terminilogy - so need help on how to lay out each piece and build the intake form, and prompts we will use by copilot to process and output results in a roadmap document and one pager powerpoint presentation - how can I do this?
- Here’s a direct, usable plan for how to **design the intake form**, **define the terminology**, **use Copilot prompts**, and **produce both a full roadmap document and a one-pager PowerPoint**—even if you’re not comfortable with roadmap jargon.
- The Roadmap Structure (What You’re Actually Building)** A solid annual roadmap typically has 6 layers: 1.
- **Strategic Goals** – the big outcomes for the year (e.g., “Improve authentication stability by 20%”).
