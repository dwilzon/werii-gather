# Edison DC current source

## Summary
where did edison get dc current from Edison didn’t “get” DC current from a single place — he **generated it himself**. Here’s the quick, direct breakdown. ## **Where Edison’s DC came from** Edison built **local power stations** that produced **direct current (DC)** using **steam-powered dynamos** that his team designed. ### 1. **He used steam engines to spin large DC generators (“dynamos”).** - A boiler made steam - Steam turned a piston engine -...

## Key Points
- where did edison get dc current from Edison didn’t “get” DC current from a single place — he **generated it himself**.
- Here’s the quick, direct breakdown.
- ## **Where Edison’s DC came from** Edison built **local power stations** that produced **direct current (DC)** using **steam-powered dynamos** that his team designed.
- **He used steam engines to spin large DC generators (“dynamos”).** - A boiler made steam - Steam turned a piston engine - The engine spun a copper-wound dynamo - The dynamo produced **low-voltage DC** ### 2.
- **He built his own generators.** Edison improved earlier dynamo designs and created the **Z-type** and **Jumbo** dynamos, custom-designed for his power stations.
- **The power came from his own power plants.** Famous example: - **Pearl Street Station** (New York City, 1882) - Ran six massive DC dynamos - Powered ~400 lamps across ~85 customers ### 4.
