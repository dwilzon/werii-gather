- If you meant a different “neon” (for example neon lighting, design style, or neon signs) I can cover that too.
- --- ### Basic facts - Symbol: **Ne** - Atomic number: **10** citeturn0search0turn0search4 - It’s part of the noble gases (Group 18 of the periodic table) — colorless, odorless, chemically inert.
- citeturn0search2turn0search6turn0search1 - Name origin: from the Greek *neos* meaning “new”.
- citeturn0search0turn0search10 --- ### Properties & abundance - At standard conditions, neon is a monatomic gas (one atom per particle) and extremely inert — essentially no stable compounds under ordinary conditions.
- citeturn0search0turn0search1 - It is the **fifth most abundant element in the universe** by mass, but on Earth it’s quite rare.

## Open Questions
- ### Why is neon rare on Earth despite being abundant in the universe?
- If you like, I can pull up **detailed data** for neon (atomic radius, ionization energy, isotopes, etc.), or show you **neon lighting technologies** and applications. Which would you prefer?
