# Personal AI bot design

## Summary
Help me create a custom personal AI bot that takes all of my notes from varius AI tools and chatbots, and compiles them into an organized and accessible manner that helps me track progress and plans / learning / skills / q&a - For example - one of the items I'm doing is learning to read hebrew modern and biblical, and speak as well, another is learning guitar, another is erning extra income podcasting using okta skills - etc... need a way to capt...

## Projects
- Hebrew Learning
- Guitar Mastery
- Podcast
- Book Writing
- IAM Engineering

## Next Actions

## Key Points
- Help me create a custom personal AI bot that takes all of my notes from varius AI tools and chatbots, and compiles them into an organized and accessible manner that helps me track progress and plans / learning / skills / q&a - For example - one of the items I'
- need a way to capture and track all of those in a meaningful way from a central source (app that we build) that we can improve over time if necessary - and also with the idea of selling access to the app to others who would find it valuable - 【turn0calculator0
- I’ll break this into: 1.
- **What the app actually *does*** (from your perspective as a user) 2.
- **Core data model** (projects, skills, notes, Q&A, etc.) 3.
- **Tech / architecture that fits you** (Node/JS + Vercel + Postgres/vector) 4.

## Open Questions
- - Why?
- Create a more detailed implementation for a specific component?
- Design the Chrome extension for capturing AI chats?
- Build out the AI insight generation system?
- Create the frontend dashboard mockup?
- I'd also like to include architectural summary diagrams that help me visualize what you are suggesting I do to build this out - also, what is the advantage of hiring someone who is freelancing to build this out and get it done more quickly 
- ## Want a visual “business-level” diagram too?
- how much would it cost to hire a developer for 4-6 weeks to build mvp - would it be ready to sell as a product?
