- The situation is nuanced, and I’ll walk you through what is known, the limitations, and what this means in practical terms.
- --- ### ✅ What we *do* know - Agent Orange contains TCDD (a dioxin) and other “chemicals of interest” (COIs).
- These are persistent, bio-accumulative toxicants.
- citeturn0search3turn0search10 - Studies show that children born to mothers exposed to herbicides in Vietnam have been found to have elevated rates of certain birth defects (for example, neural tube defects) in some investigations.
