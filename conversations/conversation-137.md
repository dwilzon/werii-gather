## Open Questions
- If you like, I can **look up current pricing** in Dallas (or Dallas-area stores), check **installation requirements**, and compare **top competitor models** (same size/price class) so you can decide. Do you want me to pull that together?
- If you like, I can **pull together current pricing in Dallas/TX**, **available installation deals**, and **user review summaries** for both models (especially long-term reliability) to help you decide. Do you want that?
- Would you like me to help you identify which version you have (Visa or Store) based on the card’s design or wording?
- - Ask a staff member: Are these kept in a humidor, what’s the humidity, when were they last stocked?
- If you like, I can **scan Brookshire Brothers’ current cigar inventory online** (for your local store or zip) and pick **3–5 good options** available now (with price and why they’re worth picking) and send links. Would that be helpful?
