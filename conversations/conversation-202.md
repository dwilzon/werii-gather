## Open Questions
- ### Which Should You Choose?
- If you like, I can run a tone comparison, show user reviews, or suggest which might work better for your guitar or style. Which direction do you lean?
- If you like, I can simulate tone comparisons (sound clips) or show you how big a difference the mix control gives in practice, so you can hear which you prefer. Want me to pull up audio demos or A/B tests so you can decide by ear?
- Would you like me to mock up a quick **side-by-side visual comparison** (gold vs nickel on a 000-28 headstock) so you can see how the vibe changes before deciding?
- ## Will it “look funny”?
- If you want, I can find **example guitars with titanium tuners** so you can see how others have done it, and compare them side-by-side with gold or nickel. Want me to dig up some visuals so you can see how titanium tuners look in real life?
