# Trailer power issue troubleshooting

## Summary
when I connect 12v power from positive battery terminal to black of 6 way trailer it gets real hot and I don’t see power to trailer If the black wire is getting hot when you connect 12 V from the battery, that’s usually a sign of a short circuit or heavy load in that circuit. On a 6-way trailer plug, black is often used for 12 V auxiliary power (charging a battery in the trailer, powering interior lights, etc.), but wire colors aren’t always cons...

## Next Actions
- [ ] You said you don’t have a white ground wire. In that case, your trailer frame itself is likely being used as the ground return path. You’ll need to ensure there’s a clean, solid connection from the plug’s ground pin to the trailer frame, an

- On a 6-way trailer plug, black is often used for 12 V auxiliary power (charging a battery in the trailer, powering interior lights, etc.), but wire colors aren’t always consistent.
- Here’s what I’d check step-by-step before trying again: 1.
- **Disconnect power immediately** – heat means something is drawing far too much current.
- **Inspect the trailer side wiring** – look for bare spots, pinched wires, or corroded connectors where the black wire could be touching ground (trailer frame or white wire if you had one).
- **Verify what the black wire does** – use a multimeter on continuity mode to see if black is connected to ground or a specific device inside the trailer.

## Open Questions
- If you want, I can give you a diagram showing **the correct way to wire a 6-way plug to a 7-way** so you know exactly where 12 V power should go and how to safely test each circuit. Would you like me to do that?
