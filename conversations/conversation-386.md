## Key Points
- What is correlation coefficient The **correlation coefficient** is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables.
- ### Most Common: **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)** - **Range**: from **-1** to **+1** | Value of r | Interpretation | |------------|-------------------------------------| | +1 | Perfect **positive** correlation | | 0 | **No** correlation | | -1 | Perfect
- - **Negative r**: As one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.
- ### Formula: \[ r = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \cdot \sigma_Y} \] Where: - **Cov(X, Y)** = Covariance of variables X and Y - **σₓ, σᵧ** = Standard deviations of X and Y ### Example: If you measure students’ study time and their exam scores, a correlation
