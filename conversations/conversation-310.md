- Major pain points include: - Users lose access to systems, often critical systems, including elevated access tied to SEC identities used to access Administrative functionality, such as super admin, things the require elevated privilages - all access is essenti
- - Company uses SailPoint to provision and de provision access, using primarily Business and IT roles.
- There is no concept of functional role that stays with a user as the data change occurs.
- - This results in operational downtime, productivity loss, and potential breaches of service level expectations for high-security operations.
- - SEC identitys (high security context eg privilaged or segmented access in AD) are not pe...

## Open Questions
- What technology could be used to improve the processes?
- Users transition experience is seamless when moving from one job to another, and no critical access is lost, certifiers are presented with greatly simplified yet effective certifications (currently we do it certification for elevated access
- Would you like help drafting the slide deck or executive summary copy for this strategic initiative? Or perhaps a fine‑tuned pilot plan outline with timelines and stakeholders?
- If helpful, I can mock up a before/after diagram or a one-pager for execs comparing **business role chaos vs. functional role clarity**. Want to go that route?
- Would you like help drafting a side-by-side comparison graphic or a communication brief for people managers to help explain how this change benefits them directly?
