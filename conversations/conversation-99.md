## Open Questions
- Did you mean the Hebrew word **מִשְׁפָּחָה (mishpachah)** — meaning *family*?
- Would you like me to include **audio pronunciation** for the word and sentences (as you prefer for Hebrew study)?
- Would you like me to include the **audio pronunciation** for *mishpatim* and the verses (as with your other Hebrew study entries)?
- Would you like me to include the **audio pronunciation** for both *mishpachah* and *mishpachot* so you can hear the singular and plural side by side?
- practically speaking, can buying the guitar if your dreams help with inspiration on writing a play?
- If you like, I can **pull recent user reviews** (2024–25) comparing these exact models, highlight how they feel in real use (for writing/practice) and compare price/availability right now. Would that be helpful?
- If you like, I can also pull **current market pricing / availability** in the U.S. (Dallas area specifically) for each model (new vs used) so you have real buying-data. Would that be helpful?
- - Your current instrument already is high quality and you’ve customised it – so the question is: Will the Taylor “upgrade” meaningfully change your creative workflow or tone in a way that justifies the cost and maybe a second instrument?
