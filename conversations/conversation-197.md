## Key Points
- Yubikey - difference registering yubikey fingerprint on macOS using Chrome or Desktop Yubikey Authenticator Here’s the distinction when you register a **YubiKey’s fingerprint (biometric model, like YubiKey Bio)** on macOS using **Chrome** vs using the **YubiKe
- **Using Chrome (or another web browser)** - Chrome uses **WebAuthn / FIDO2 standards** to talk to the YubiKey.
- - When you register the fingerprint through Chrome, it’s tied to a **website or service account** (e.g., logging into your Okta account, Google, Microsoft, GitHub, etc.).
- - The fingerprint is enrolled locally on the YubiKey itself, but Chrome only facilitates the **credential creation** and the binding to that service.
- - In this case, the fingerprint is just used for **user verification** before the YubiKey releases the authentication credential to the site.
- - Think of this as **service-specific registration**.

## Open Questions
- Do you want me to also map out **a real-world workflow** (e.g., logging into Okta with Chrome using the YubiKey **and** then using the Authenticator app for a different service) so you can see how both play together in daily use?
- Would you like me to create a **shortlist of 2–3 names with matching icons/colors** (for labels or NFC app displays) so you can visually distinguish your YubiKey too?
- Would you like me to also draw a **signal flow diagram** (guitar → DI → mixer/interface) showing where impedance matters, so it’s easier to see in practice?
- Would you like me to give you a **real-world analogy** (like water flow or traffic) to make the difference between resistance and impedance more intuitive?
- Would you like me to sketch out a **side-by-side diagram of DC vs AC flow** (arrows and sine wave style) so you can see it at a glance?
- Do you want me to also show you **an alternate pedal order** (Session first, then SansAmp) and what changes tonally, so you can decide which order fits your style best?
- Would you like me to draft a **simple pedalboard layout diagram** (signal flow arrows) showing both setups so you can easily A/B them?
- Would you like me to make you a **visual diagram of a pedalboard layout** (with Anthem → Session → SansAmp → PA/Interface) so you can see how it’s wired?
