## Key Points
- what does it mean Adam is a type of christ Great question — this is classic **biblical typology** language.
- When someone says **“Adam is a type of Christ”** they’re drawing on the way the New Testament (especially Paul) uses Adam as a **pattern or foreshadowing** of Jesus.
- A **type** (Greek: *τύπος*, *typos*) means a **model, pattern, imprint, or foreshadowing** of something greater to come — the *antitype*.

## Open Questions
- 👉 Would you like me to make a **side-by-side chart of Moses vs. Christ**, like I offered with Adam, so you can see how each point of Moses’ life connects with Jesus?
- Would you like me to show you this with a **timeline-style chart** (Adam → Fall → Death vs. Christ → Cross → Life) so you can see the progression visually?
- Would you like me to make a **3-level chart (Adam → Christ → Believers)** so you can clearly see how Adam’s type points to Christ and then flows down to us as saints?
- Would it help if I gave you a **visual diagram** showing “type → fulfillment” across Adam, Moses, David, etc., all pointing toward Christ?
