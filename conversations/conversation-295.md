# Freeze drying process

## Summary
how does freeze dried work Freeze-drying (also called **lyophilization**) is a preservation process that removes water from food (or other materials) while keeping its structure, flavor, and nutrients intact. Here’s how it works step by step: ### 1. Freezing - The food (or material) is first frozen solid, usually very quickly to form small ice crystals. - This step locks everything in place—texture, color, nutrients, and shape. ### 2. Vacuum Cham...

## Key Points
- how does freeze dried work Freeze-drying (also called **lyophilization**) is a preservation process that removes water from food (or other materials) while keeping its structure, flavor, and nutrients intact.
- Here’s how it works step by step: ### 1.
- Freezing - The food (or material) is first frozen solid, usually very quickly to form small ice crystals.
- - This step locks everything in place—texture, color, nutrients, and shape.
- Vacuum Chamber - The frozen food is placed in a special chamber where the air pressure is lowered (a vacuum is created).
- - This low-pressure environment makes it possible for ice to **sublimate** (turn directly from solid ice into water vapor) without melting first.

## Open Questions
- Would you like me to explain **how this is different from regular dehydration** (like dried fruit or jerky), so you can see why it’s considered superior?
