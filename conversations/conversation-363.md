## Key Points
- find a discovery magazine article from the late 70’s that talked about how matter could be broken down infinitely I couldn’t locate a specific **Discover** magazine article from the late 1970s stating that matter could be broken down infinitely.
- However, this topic was widely discussed during that era in both popular and academic science outlets, riding the wave of renewed interest in atomic theory and quantum mechanics.
- Here’s some helpful context: --- ### 🧬 Why this was a hot topic in the late ’70s - By the late 1970s, the **Standard Model** had classified fundamental particles (quarks, leptons, gauge bosons) as “point-like” and indivisible citeturn0search0turn0search2.
- - Yet philosophical questions lingered: *Could space, time, or matter themselves be infinitely divisible?* — echoing age‑old paradoxes from Zeno, Aristotle, and Democritus citeturn0search2.
- - Even if quarks were fundamental, their point-like nature puzzled physicists: how do zero-dimensional points build finite-size protons?
- --- ### 🔍 Steps to find the exact article While I couldn’t find the exact piece, here are strategies that may help: 1.
