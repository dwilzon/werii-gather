## Open Questions
- If you’d like, I can pull **current pricing**, compare this model vs a few alternatives (same size, similar features) so you can see if it’s a good deal. Would that be helpful?
- If you like, I can check current real-world pricing for both (Dallas area / online) and show you deals + expected installation costs so you can decide which offers better bang for your money. Would you like that?
- If you like, I can pull up **current Dallas / Texas area pricing** (including installation cost estimates) for a small set of models (KitchenAid & Bosch) right now so you can compare deals. Would you like me to do that?
- If you like, I can check **current pricing (Dallas area / online)** for the KDFS424SPS *and* two comparable models (one slightly simpler, one alternative brand) so you can see how the cost/feature trade-off looks right now. Would that be he
- If you like, I can **pull side-by-side test data or review comparisons** (user reviews, reliability reports) specifically comparing KitchenAid 30-jet vs 50-jet models to see if users “notice” the difference in everyday life. Would that be h
- If you like, I can **narrow down to 2 best models available right now in the Dallas area (Texas) under ~$1000**, show current deals, their installation costs, and compare which offers the best “clean + quiet + reliability” for your budget. 
- If you like, I can check *three more models* (within ~$700-$1000) available in Dallas with local store/online stocks + installation estimates so you have a **mini-comparison set of 4 models** before you buy. Would you like that?
- If you like, I can check **current Dallas/Fort-Worth area pricing** for the Bosch SHP65CM5N (or equivalent SKU) as well as **installation cost estimates**, so you can see what you should budget for. Would you like me to pull that?
