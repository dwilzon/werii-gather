## Key Points
- was king david born out of wedlock The Bible does not say that King David was born out of wedlock.
- ### What Scripture Tells Us David’s parents were Jesse (יִשַׁי *Yishai*) and his wife.
- Jesse is described as a respected man of Bethlehem, and David is listed as the youngest of his eight sons (1 Samuel 16:10–13; 1 Chronicles 2:13–15).
- The text presents David’s birth as legitimate within Jesse’s household.
- ### Why the Question Arises - **Psalm 51:5**: David says, *“Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.”* Some interpret this to mean David’s mother sinned when conceiving him.
- But most Jewish and Christian commentators read it differently—David is expressing the universal reality of human sinfulness from birth, not confessing that he was illegitimate.

## Open Questions
- Do you want me to expand this chart all the way through the **Messianic line** (showing how Yeshua is said to come through these same “questionable” branches)?
- Would you like me to also **annotate the chart with Scripture references** under each king so you can use it as a teaching/study visual?
- Would you like me to also show you what **Jewish and early Christian tradition** adds about Joseph (his age, occupation, possible death, etc.), or do you want to keep just to what the Bible itself says?
- 👉 Would you like me to make a **visual chart of the top 10 most important “silent figures”** (Joseph, Jesse, certain apostles, etc.) with references — so you can use it for Bible study?
- Would you like me to also show you how **Jewish and early Christian commentators** wrestled with the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy (virgin vs. young woman) and how it connects to Yeshua’s conception?
- 👉 Would you like me to create a **visual parallel chart** (Temple overshadowing vs. Mary’s overshadowing) so you can see how Luke is deliberately echoing Exodus?
- 👉 Do you want me to **map these moments on a timeline** (Eden → Abraham → Sinai → Prophets → Messiah) so you can see the progression of how Hashem’s “walking with man” develops through Scripture?
- 👉 Would you like me to build you a **side-by-side chart (Hebrew → LXX Greek → NT use)** so you can see exactly how “overshadow” develops from Exodus → Psalms → Luke?
