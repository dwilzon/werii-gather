## Open Questions
- Would you like me to explain how this concept reappears throughout Scripture (for example, in Proverbs, Isaiah, or the teachings of Yeshua about “wisdom” and “life”)?
- Would you like me to explain how this idea connects to the Hebrew concept of *kedushah* (holiness as “set apart consistency”)?
- Would you like me to show how this idea (God’s inability to sin) contrasts with humanity’s *potential* for holiness through alignment with His Spirit?

- Would you like me to show how the “first Adam” and “last Adam” parallel each other — one bringing death, the other restoring life?
