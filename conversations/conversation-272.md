## Open Questions
- Would you like me to **draft a suggested starter folder + tag schema in a visual chart** (like a table that maps folders → example tags → smart folders) so you can copy it directly into Notes?
- Would you like me to **draw this out as a table (Folders → Example Notes → Example Tags → Smart Folder view)** so you can copy/paste it as your “Apple Notes playbook”?
- Where would I place a note for Perogy Recipe?
- Would you like me to sketch a **tagging scheme for recipes** (e.g. cuisine, course, family vs personal) so you can search “Ukrainian recipes” or “Holiday desserts” instantly?
- Can I leverage a gpt to help me stay on top of my organization structure for notes that I've decided to build?
- Would you like me to **draft a reusable GPT prompt** you could save (like “Notes Organizer Assistant”) so whenever you paste new notes, GPT will auto-classify them into your folder/tag system?
- Would you like me to **draft a visual table (Folders → Example Notes → Suggested Tags → Smart Folder Views)** so you can literally copy it as your “Notes Organization Playbook”?
- What if I don't want a media & hobbies subfolder, what would one big Personal folder look like - could there be hundreds or thousands of notes in that folder?
