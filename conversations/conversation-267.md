## Key Points
- were any of books of the new testament written in hebrew or aramaic originally Most scholars agree that the **New Testament books were written in Greek**, specifically *Koine Greek*, which was the common trade and literary language of the eastern Roman Empire 
- That said, there are some nuances worth noting: ### 1.
- Hebrew or Aramaic Sources - **Jesus and the apostles almost certainly spoke Aramaic (and some Hebrew)** in daily life.
- So many of Yeshua’s sayings, teachings, and prayers would have been delivered originally in Aramaic/Hebrew, then later recorded in Greek.
- - For example, the Gospels preserve a few *Aramaic words* (like *Talitha koum* in Mark 5:41 or *Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani* in Mark 15:34).
- The Gospel of Matthew - Early church writers (like Papias around 100 CE and Irenaeus later) claimed that **Matthew wrote his Gospel in “the Hebrew language”** (which could mean either Hebrew or Aramaic), and that it was later translated into Greek.

## Open Questions
- Would you like me to show you **specific examples of where the Greek text preserves Hebrew/Aramaic phrases**, so you can see how those Semitic roots peek through?
- Would you like me to show you how the **Hebrew Bible and the New Testament each use specific Hebrew/Greek words related to “will/choice”** (like *ratsón*, *bāḥar*, *thelēma*) so you can see the concept in the original languages?
- Do you want me to also compare that to distances in space (like how many times around Earth, or how close that gets you to the Sun)?
- How long does it take for the speed of light to travel 157,000,000 miles?
- \frac{157,000,000}{186,282} \approx ?
- Would you like me to show you a **comparison chart** (Earth–Moon, Earth–Sun, and your 157 million miles) to see how travel times at light speed line up?
- Would you like me to put that into perspective (e.g., how far that is compared to the distance to Pluto or the edge of the solar system)?
- Do you want me to also show you what **distance in miles** that would be (by converting 87.85 billion light-years into miles)?
