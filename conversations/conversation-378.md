## Key Points
- What is PKI and device attestation/ **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)** and **device attestation** are both security mechanisms used to establish **trust** in digital communications, but they operate at different levels and for different purposes.
- Here's a breakdown: --- ### 🔐 What is PKI?
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** is a system of hardware, software, policies, and standards that manages **digital certificates** and **public/private key pairs** to enable: - **Authentication** – proving identity.
- - **Encryption** – securing data.
- - **Integrity** – ensuring data hasn't been altered.
- #### 🔑 How it works: - Each entity (user, device, server) has: - A **private key** (kept secret).
