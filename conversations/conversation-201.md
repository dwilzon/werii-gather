# Peg hole reamer size

## Summary
what size peg hole reamer is needed to install lr baggs anthem The LR Baggs **Anthem** installation manual says: > “Use a drill bit with a diameter that is large enough for the pickup to fit through but *no larger than the width of the slot, usually between 3/32” and 1/8”*. ” citeturn0search5 So for the peg-hole exit that the pickup wire passes through, a reamer (or drill bit) somewhere between **3/32″ (~2.38 mm)** and **1/8″ (3.175 mm)** is a...

- [ ] Since your saddle slot is probably ~2.5 mm, the lower end (3/32″) is closer. But you might need to open slightly more (up to 1/8″) depending on clearance needed.

- If you tell me more about your instrument (e.g.
- bridge thickness, slot width, what is currently drilled) I can help you pick the ideal size.

## Open Questions
- If you like, I can look up the specific saddle slot width or chambering in your exact MD model and give a more precise recommendation. Do you want me to do that?
- If you like, I can try to find a service or schematic for your exact year’s 000-28 MD to see whether its saddle slot leans more toward 2.4 or 2.7 mm, which might let you pick a more accurate bit size. Do you want me to dig that?
- Would you like me to build you a **side-by-side setup chain** (one for church, one for home/recording) so you can see exactly what’s needed in each environment?
- Would you like me to also build you a **budget-friendly setup list** (essentials only, no frills) *and* a **pro setup list** (everything optimized for tone and control), so you can decide what to buy first?
- Would you like me to also map this into a **step-by-step upgrade path** (what to buy first, second, third) so you can build toward the pro setup over time?
